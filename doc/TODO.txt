Artifacts:
* Royal Aegis
   gold tower shield

* wyrd-wand, -staff and -lance

* add description optional attribute to tiles, which would be printed when player
  steps on them (eg. "You enter an unused sewer node.")
* randomized death messages:
   "The foo is slain."
   "The foo dies screaming."
   "You kill the foo."
* AFLAME equipment burns self and if used as weapon, victim
* magical items:
    white robe - white magic (light and life spells cost less)
    black robe - black magic (dark and death spells cost less)
    staff of life - powered by life (receiving heal also restore MP)
    staff of light - powered by light
    staff of dakness - powered by darkness
    staff of death - powered by death (killing restores MP)

    powered by pain - high pain greatly increases SP regen
    powered by hate - low HP greatly increases SP regen
* item prefixes
   weapons - bonus damage, inflicts
   ranged weapons - range+
   special-case staffs
   descriptions
* climbing out of pit without tools had (Dex mod + Agi mod)= chance of success, with
  failure randomly doing nothing, making you stunned or taking damage from fall
